This example shows how to deploy a Gluster cluster end-to-end.

The cluster-vars.yml file contains variables for setting the backend disks using
LVM thinpool and creating a Gluster volume. The example playbook creates a
replica 2 volume with 4 bricks (2x2), but any volume type can be created.

Usage:
To run the playbook create an inventory file containing the hosts in question.
Edit the inventory file to suit your needs. And run the playbook:

$ ansible-playbook -i path-to-inventory gluster_volume.yml
